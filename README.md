# time_to_get_serious
A restart on my coding career after a bit of time travelling


Here's my first update in nearly a year, and definitely my first serious bit of work in the last year and a half. We go again.

First rule of working on git repos - make sure you have a main, and a secondary development branch. NEVER PUSH DIRECT TO MAIN. Push to secondary and make sure it all works before merging to main.

Secondly, make sure that you never commit to main on a Friyay!
